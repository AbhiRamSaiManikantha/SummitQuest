# SummitQuest

Project Summary  
SummitQuest is a career-oriented web app designed to guide users through setting goals, tracking progress, and achieving milestones. It starts with a simple login/sign-up flow, collects basic details, then helps users choose and pursue career objectives with structured steps.

High-Level Actions  
1. User Authentication – Sign-up, login, session management.  
2. User Profile – Capture personal bio, age, country, and location.  
3. Career Objective Selection – Let users choose goals or paths.  
4. Progress Tracking – Milestones, achievements, and updates.  
5. Documentation – Maintain design notes, API references, and development flow.  

Project Structure  
/frontend   → React (UI, user interaction)  
/backend    → Node/Express (API, database handling)  
/docs       → Architecture, planning, design notes  

Next Steps  
- Set up GitHub repo structure.  
- Initialize frontend & backend separately.  
- Document Week-by-Week roadmap in /docs.
